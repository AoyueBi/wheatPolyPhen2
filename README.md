# wheatPolyPhen2
wheatPolyPhen2 is scripts atlas that performs functional annotation of SNPs, maps coding SNPs to gene transcripts, extracts protein sequence annotations and structural attributes, and builds conservation profiles. The PolyPhen-2 Wiki site is at <http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/dokuwiki/start>. Here we will provide a brief pipeline and some important precautions when estimating the probability of the missense mutation being damading.
